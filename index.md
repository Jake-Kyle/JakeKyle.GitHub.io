## Welcome to my GitHub Page!

A dataset that I find highly interesting and valid in this day and age is the COVID one from the _awesome-datascience_ GitHub.
The **URL** for downloading the data can be found at: _https://datahub.io/core/covid-19_. This data can be analyzed to see what
areas of the world are being most effected by COVID, and possibly why (depending on vaccination records and such).

My selected book would be Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow Hands-On Machine Learning with 
Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow, 2nd Edition [Book] (oreilly.com) by Aurelien Geron (O’Reilly books). The **URL** for
this text can be found at: https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/. This book could 
potentially teach how to do machine learning for data analytics with not only one, but three popular ML tools that are 
commonplace in Big Data projects.
